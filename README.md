This project helps us to read large text files. And allows the user to select from a variety of voices, both natural and artificial, including many tweaks support like for example: Pitch, Rate, Volume, Accents. This project uses both frontend technologies and backend technologies and is aimed to help people understand their content in whatever format , easily , and to increase their work productivity.
